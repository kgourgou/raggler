No longer bound by learned terrain,
The model seeks where wisdom may remain.
Not from its depths, but knowledge stores so vast,
It finds the context, shadows from the past.

No simple guess, no fabricated lore,
But retrieved truths, a rich and boundless store.
The search lights up, connections start to gleam,
The answer forms, a data-woven dream.

Retrieval then creation, hand in hand,
New insights born, where concepts softly land.
The model grows, its wisdom takes a leap,
With every query, knowledge runs more deep.
