      "Upper bounds often provide a maximum value or limit that a function, sequence, or set can attain. They are used in various mathematical proofs and theorems to establish conditions or constraints. One cool fact about upper bounds is that they can be used to prove the existence of an optimal solution in optimization problems. For example, in the field of convex optimization, the Weierstrass theorem states that a continuous real-valued function defined on a compact convex set in a Euclidean space attains its minimum value at some point in the set. This theorem relies on the concept of an upper bound, which helps establish the existence of an optimal solution.\n",

      "In another context, the pigeonhole principle is a simple but powerful combinatorial result that states, in its basic form, that if you put n objects into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain two or more objects. This principle can be used to prove upper bounds on the number of objects that can be distributed into a fixed number of containers while ensuring that no container has too many objects. This fact highlights the importance of upper bounds in understanding and controlling the behavior of mathematical objects.\n",
