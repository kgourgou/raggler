      "CUPED, or \"Controlled-Experiment using Pre-experiment Data,\" is a method proposed by Deng, Xu, Kohavi, and Walker in 2013. It aims to reduce the variance of the ATE (average treatment effect) estimator by utilizing pre-existing data, specifically covariates ($X_i$) and past values of the outcome variable ($Y$) before the experiment took place. The approach involves fitting a linear model using these pre-experiment data to create control variates, which are then used to adjust the ATE estimator. This helps improve the accuracy and precision of the estimated treatment effect.\n",
